What is design?

Design is the mapping of concepts into the implementation detail.
It is the mapping of ideas based the languages, libraries, frameworks, etc.

Bridge between the domain and the implementation.

What is a good design?
-Easily extensible
-Easy to understand
  -easy to navigate
-Easy to change
-Readable
-Easy to maintain
-loosely coupled
-it is relevant and serves the intended purpose
  -supports business needs
-self explanatory
-easy to repeat
-simple
 -avoid unnecessary complexity
-scalable
-easy to test *****
-easy to debug and to monitor
-easy to deploy
-modular
-...

Economic concerns and impact

We want to lower the cost of change and also reduce the frequency of change.
Cost effective.


Characteristics of good design
-Simple
-Fewer moving parts
-Relevant
-highly cohesive
-low and loose coupling

Cohesion:
Code that is narrow and focused, does one thing really well
Like things are together and unlike things are apart
Why?: The changes needs to be less frequent and thus the cost of change is minimized

High cohesion means that like things are more together.
Low cohesion means that things that do not belong together appears in one place.

Strive for high cohesion.

Coupling:
Low instead of high coupling
Loose instead of tight coupling


Low coupling is where a piece of code depends on fewer things.
Low coupling is a concern in *all* programming languages and environments.

Why?: If we depend on more things our code will have to change more often. We want
to minimize the frequency of change of different parts of an application.

Tight coupling is where we depend on something that is concrete.  Loose coupling is
where we depend on something that is abstract, like an interface.

Interfaces are more stable than classes. Loose coupling, again, minimizes the frequency of change.

Dynamically typed languages (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc.) naturally favor loose coupling.
Statically typed languages (C++, Java, C#, Scala, etc.) need our effort to create loose coupling.

Also, keep in mind that inheritance is tight coupling, so choose it wisely.

Favor low coupling *and* also loose coupling.
