Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous, authoritative source of representation.

Single Source of Truth

Duplication of effort, not just duplication of code.

If we do manual testing, that is a violation of the DRY principle
If we do manual deployment, that is a violation of the DRY priciple
