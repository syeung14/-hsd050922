Remote  -------> RemoteControlled
                 Tv, Fan, etc. implement RemoteControlled

What is good about this design?
Remote is extensible and is loosely coupled to TV, etc. via a RemoteControlled interface

A TV instance, for example, may have multiple remotes if we like
A remote is universal, without change it can control any device that implements RemoteControlled.

What needs to be improved?
TV, Fan, etc. sadly had to implement an interface just because remote wants it.
In the future we may have to implement other no directly related interfaces because something else wants it

The up and down are polluting the public interface of TV, Fan, etc. even though they are really useful from a Remote and not as much directly on the instance.

It is possible that we may have method collision if muliple interfaces have the same methods, like up, but with different intent.

What if we wanted some features specific for one remote, for example, a remote with a light, that we don't want for other remotes? Hard to implement that in the current design.
