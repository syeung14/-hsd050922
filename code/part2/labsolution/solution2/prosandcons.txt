Remote  (interface)
                        Tv
			   We will create a TV specfic Remote implementation
       		        Fan
			   We will create a Fan specfic Remote implementation
		        ...

What is good about this design?

Remote is ultimately extensible
We can have any number of remotes for a given TV insance, for example
We can have a Remote be universal to control any device that provides an implementation
for the Remote interface (as an inner class)
No method collision
we are not polluting the public interface of a TV, for example, with up and down
We can provide special implementations and properties in TV's Remote implemention for example



What needs to be improved?

There is no consistency in how TV, Fan, etc. provide the implementation. Some may call it
getRemote, some may call it getARemote, etc. To bring consistency, we may have to
implement an interface.
