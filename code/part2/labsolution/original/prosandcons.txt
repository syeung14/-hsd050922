Observations from the given code:
Remote has tight coupling to TV, Fan, etc. and is not extensible.

We can have any number of remotes for a TV instance or a Fan instance, etc.
A Remote may be used to control a TV, a Fan, etc. - universal remote (even though the current design is not extensible)


Design idea:

Create an interface (RemoteControlled) that will contain the common methods needed by
the Remote and let TV, etc. implement it.

May be another idea as well....
