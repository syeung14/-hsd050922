What is extensibility?

-The code can do something different than before, based on reasonable change in
requirements, with minimum cost and effort for change.

A piece of code can't be arbitrarily extensible.

For a code to be extensible we have to anticipate the types of changes that are expected.

If we make code extensible for what is not probable then the code becomes unnecessarily
complex and hard to maintain as well.

Who can anticipate change well?

There are 3 kinds of people in every team that makes software:
1. Those who know software design really well, but know nothing about the domain
2. Those who know the domain really well, but know little about software design
3. (very few) Those who know software design and the domain really well
4. (we will politely not talk about this 4th type)

To anticipate well we need both good knowledge of the domain and have software design skills

Because most people are in group 1 or 2, we have to collaborate to create extensible solutions

First step for extensibility is to anticipate well about what is expected reasonably in the future.
